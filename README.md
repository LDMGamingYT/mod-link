# Mod Link

An innovative way to share mods.

## How does it work?

Upload mods to your server just like normal, but now, players can download the mods directly to their game with the click of **one button!**
No more hassle trying to send the mod files, just get your players to press the `Download Mods` button before connecting!

## Technical Details

This mod uses a secure TCP connection to transfer mod files using packets in 1 MB large chunks.
