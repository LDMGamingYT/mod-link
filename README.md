# Mod Link
An innovative way to share mods.

## How does it work?
Upload mods to your server just like normal, but now, players can download the mods directly to their game with the click of **one button!**
No more hassle trying to send the mod files, just get your players to press the `Download Mods` button before connecting!

## Technical Details
This mod uses the FTP protocol to share mods in a **read-only** environment across the internet.

**You should use port `25555` for Mod Link. You can use another port, but Mod Link will NOT be able to find it automatically.**
