# Mod Link
An innovative way to share mods.

## How does it work?
Upload mods to your server just like normal, but now, players can download the mods directly to their game with the click of **one button!**
No more hassle trying to send the mod files, just get your players to press the `Download Mods` button before connecting!

## Technical Details
This mod uses the FTP protocol to share mods in a **read-only** enviroment across the internet. Simply define the `mod-link-port` in your `server.properties` file, and you're good to go!
