# Mod Link

An innovative way to share mods.

## How does it work?

Upload mods to your server just like normal, but now, players can download the mods directly to their game with the click of **one button!**  
No more hassle trying to send the mod files, just get your players to press the `Download Mods` button before connecting!

## Technical Details

This mod uses a secure TCP connection to transfer mod files using packets in 1 MB (0.95 MiB) large chunks. It also integrates itself into the existing connecting Minecraft uses for S2C and C2S communication, so just drag the mod in and it works!
